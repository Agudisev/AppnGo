# AppnGo
Contact/employee less convenient store

This project aimed to create a shopping experince similar to the Amazon go store while utilizing far less hardawre. The project consists of an IOS based app which serves as the main hub for the user. We used NFC tags and the NFC capabilty on the iphone. The user can simply tap the item and the item would be registered in the app, From there the user can either delete the item or if they are done shopping; they can simply exit the store and their card on file would be charged for the amount of prodcuts they purchased. We also mainted a database of users and the user had to be registerd in our data base to enter the store.
